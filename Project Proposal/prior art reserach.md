| Universal Spam Detection using Transfer Learning of BERT Model | https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03480                             | Author used a BERT model to encode the email then a deep nn 3 layers deep to classify ham / spam.<br />Author tried to get BERT to output a CLS (class) token directly but did not get good results. |
| Devising and Detecting Phishing Emails Using Large Language Models | https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10466545 | Authors used LLM to devise and detect phishing emails. The tested the devised emails on humans to see what click through rate they got and compared them to emails generated by human experts. They tested the LLM's ability to detect both LLM generated phishing emails and human generated phishing emails. **Maybe we can ask them to share the synthetic emails they generated** |
| ChatSpamDetector: Leveraging Large Language Models for Effective Phishing Email Detection | https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18093                             | Used GPT4, 3.5, llama2, gemeni pro to classify phishing / legitimate and demonstrated >99% accuracy. They compare to several DL baselines.<br />They also have a cost analysis: ```Cost Analysis We did a cost analysis for the experiments using the ChatGPT API (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5). The cost per input was $0.03 for GPT-4 and $0.002 for GPT-3.5, while the cost per output was $0.06 for GPT-4 and $0.002 for GPT-3.5. Analyzing the 2,010 emails in our dataset, the cost of using GPT-4 with a normal prompt was $265.80 and for GPT-3.5 was $13.68, while using a simple prompt resulted in costs of $249.93 for GPT-4 and $12.62 for GPT-3.5.``` |
| SecureNet: A Comparative Study of DeBERTa and Large Language Models for Phishing Detection | https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06663                             | Trained DeBERTa model on hugging face's phishing dataset + synthetic emails. **Maybe we can ask them to share the synthetic emails they generated.** And they compared that to just feeding it to GPT 4 and Gemini 1.5 with a fine tuned prompt. |
| Evaluating Large Language Models for Phishing Detection, Self-Consistency, Faithfulness, and Explainability | https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13746                             | They used LoRA to finetune models like BERT, llama2.7, 3.8 and wizard 7B using Binary Sequence Classification, Direct Preference Optimization, and Contrastive Learning approaches. With results over 90% |
