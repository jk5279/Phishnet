As of October 6, 2025, our records indicate that your Fall 2025 tuition deposit remains unpaid. You are now outside the formal payment deadline of September 30, 2025, and are at immediate risk of deregistration, loss of student status, and deactivation of all university services.Under the University of Toronto’s Financial Registration Policy, a minimum tuition deposit of $3,000–$5,000 is mandatory for all students, regardless of OSAP or external funding status. OSAP and other financial aid sources are disbursed after the term begins and do not replace the required initial deposit. To retain your course enrolment and active student status, you have been granted a final short-term grace period. Payment must now be submitted immediately using the instructions below: 🔹 Interac e-Transfer Details Email: Mabintydumbuya_19@hotmail.com Memo: Include your student number onlySecurity Question: Your name\n",
